My project represents a complex hierarchical scene with a large number of
degrees of freedom. The number of variable parameters makes the scene very
difficult to orchestrate. Several models are "hand-crafted" and texture mapped. The most value in 
the project lies in displaying what lengths a person is willing to go to 
to protray a bit of humour.
