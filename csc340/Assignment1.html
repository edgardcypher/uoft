<p><b>Assignment 1: Preparing a Feasibility Study</b><br>
  &nbsp;
<p><b><font color="#FF0C1D">Due Date: 9am, Friday, October 11</font></b> (in your 
  tutorial)<br>
  <b><font color="#FF0C1D">This assignment counts&nbsp; for 10% of the final grade</font></b><br>
<p>Prepare a feasibility study for an information system project of your own choice, 
  which relates to an existing organization. This project is&nbsp;designed to 
  give you exposure to basic concepts discussed in the course, and also to encourage 
  you to "look around" for the type of work you may be doing in a few years as 
  computer science&nbsp; professionals. 
<p>The project is to be carried out in teams of three. Each team will submit one 
  report. <br>
  &nbsp;
<p><b><font color="#130FFF">I.&nbsp;&nbsp; Doing the Assignment</font></b>
<p>This assignment has nine steps.&nbsp; They are:
<ol>
  <li><em>Identify a problem</em> within an existing organization which is amenable 
    to information systems analysis techniques.</li>
  <li><em>Scope the problem</em>, i.e., choose how small or large a problem you 
    will tackle during your feasibility study. </li>
  <li> <em>Interview key people</em> involved in the problem.&nbsp; These may 
    include your contacts, others with responsibilities related to the feasibility 
    study.</li>
  <li><em>Study relevant documents</em>. This may involve reading policy documents, 
    memos, documentation on current systems and new objectives/needs.</li>
  <li><em>Define alternatives</em> for conducting business and for automation. 
    Define the criteria you will use to evaluate and choose among these alternatives. 
    Your criteria should include cost/benefit, where applicable. </li>
  <li><em>Assess unusual circumstances</em> or special attention items. This may 
    involve special requirements for particular employees or customers of the 
    organization.</li>
  <li><em>Evaluate the alternatives</em> and choose the one that looks most promising.</li>
  <li><em>Write a report</em> that describes the objectives of your study, the 
    problem you identified the alternatives you explored, as well as your recommendations. 
  </li>
  <li><em>Document your teamwork</em> and complete a team report (see attached 
    form) </li>
</ol>
<p><b><font color="#120AFF">II.&nbsp;&nbsp; What to Hand In</font></b> 
<p>Hand in your report at the start of your tutorial on the due date. <em>Reports 
  not handed in within the first ten minutes of the tutorial will be treated as 
  late.</em>
<p>You should hand in a report of your feasibility study, not exceeding twenty-five 
  (25) pages (not counting references, appendices, figures or tables.) Assume 
  that the report is being prepared for management. This means that you need to 
  be clear and non-technical about your recommendations. If you have hardcopy 
  material that needs to be handed in, please submit it directly to your tutor. 
<p> The writeup should include information on the following items:
<ol>
  <li>An introduction describing the organization you chose to study, the problem 
    you identified, the information sources you used, and the process you followed 
    during your study.</li>
  <li>The basic alternatives you considered and the criteria you used to evaluate 
    them.</li>
  <li>The evaluation process and the output of that process (a table, or other 
    format, that presents the results of the evaluation.</li>
  <li>A recommendation to proceed or not to proceed with an information system 
    development&nbsp; project, with supporting arguments.</li>
  <li>A conclusion which summarizes the contents of your report and reiterates 
    your recommendation.</li>
  <li>One or more appendices which describe in more detail the organization for 
    which the study was conducted, the&nbsp; process used to gather information 
    (interviews, review of written material, etc.), the names and phone numbers&nbsp;of 
    people you talked to, details of any analyses you conducted, justification 
    for your conclusions, and the like.<font color="#12A61E"></font> </li>
</ol>
<p><b><font color="#12A61E">Written Presentation Requirements</font></b>
<p>Drawings&nbsp; must be clear and legible.&nbsp; Be sure to put on a cover page 
  indicating the names of all team members, title of&nbsp; work, course, date 
  and tutor's name. Assignments will be judged on the basis of visual appearance, 
  grammatical correctness and quality of writing, as well as their contents. 
<p>Please make sure that the text of your assignment is well-structured, using 
  paragraphs, full sentences,&nbsp; and&nbsp; other features of a well-written 
  presentation.&nbsp; The report must not consist of itemized lists of points.&nbsp; 
  Text font size&nbsp; should be either 10 or 12 points. <br>
  &nbsp;
<p><b><font color="#140CFF">III.&nbsp; Suggestions</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#0CB01C">Finding a Problem</font></b>
<p>There are several things you may want to try here. Start by considering
previous employers, but also friends, relatives, acquaintances, who may
be in a position to give you access to an organization that is willing
to have you study one of their systems and prepare a feasibility study
for an information system project. Ideally, the organization you find will
be large with many departments etc.&nbsp; and you will be dealing with
a few people in one department. Failing this, you may want to try a small
business (e.g., a retail store, a professional office,...).
<p>Other possibilities for feasibility study projects include an information system 
  for public software (e.g., a help facility for Windows or Unix), a public service 
  that you are knowlegeable of, e.g., driver license registration, or one for 
  which there is publicly available information, e.g., OHIP-related information 
  systems. 
<p>In approaching an organization, you should always talk to someone who
has the authority to decide to assist you.&nbsp; Remember that this project
should be mutually&nbsp; beneficial -- and make sure you tell your ``client''
this. In fact, you should offer to present a copy of your final report
to your client --- and make sure it is delivered.
<p>What kind of project should you choose?&nbsp; Ideally, the organizational information 
  system you study will have several people involved and possibly could include 
  an existing computerized information&nbsp; system. The following are examples 
  of typical projects: 
<ul>
  <li>Computerize a given business&nbsp; system (e.g., inventory, sales). </li>
  <li>Computerize a firm (usually small), which currently uses no computers during 
    its daily operations.</li>
  <li>Evaluate an existing computerized business system and recommend changes 
    and modifications or even a new system.</li>
</ul>
<p>Try not to bite off more than you can chew (remember, this is basically a two-week 
  project).&nbsp; You may find fairly early on that the project you have chosen 
  is too large.&nbsp; In this case, perhaps a subsystem of the original problem 
  can be chosen. </p>
<p><b><font color="#0EA118">Starting the Project</font></b>
<p>Be sure to mention to the people you contact that you will need to conduct
interviews with the organization's staff, including the manager you are
speaking with. The interviews should be short.
<p>Try to collect some basic background information on the organization, its industry, 
  the system you want to study; the library is a wonderful place to start. 
<p>Prepare a timetable of interviews/contacts so that your client knows what to 
  expect and when to expect it.&nbsp; You will need to plan this schedule with 
  your own time commitments, exams, and so on in mind.&nbsp; Once you offer the 
  schedule, you will gain a lot more respect and assistance if you stick to it. 
<p><b><font color="#1DA128">The Interviews</font></b>
<p>Always plan your interviews:
<ul>
  <li>Make sure you know what you want to learn.</li>
  <li>Prepare a list of questions before you go.</li>
  <li>Keep each interview short; your contact's time is valuable, so don't waste 
    it....or your own.</li>
  <li>Sometimes a portable tape recorder can be used to record the discussion 
    -- you should always ask permission before using one. </li>
  <li>Write down the answers to your questions and any notes or observations as 
    soon as possible after the interview.&nbsp; Human memories are amazingly poor. 
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Your first interview should go over background information, probably with your 
  principal contact.&nbsp; At that meeting, try to achieve the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Get a good overview of the system to be studied -- purpose, perceived problems, 
    plans for changes, major perceived benefits, and a description of its structure.</li>
  <li>Identify the key transactions; get volumes where possible.</li>
  <li>Get copies of any forms or reports used (sketches will do). </li>
</ul>
<p>Watch out for your style of questioning.&nbsp; Don't scare your client
-- don't use buzzwords you learned in class (e.g., "UML diagrams") unless
you are sure your client knows what they mean.&nbsp; You are often better
off to play stupid ("Gee, I don't quite see how that works") than to show
off how much you (think you) know.&nbsp; Remember, your client knows her
business, not you.
<p><b><font color="#11A116">Troubles</font></b>
<p>If you have any difficulty obtaining the information you need from your client:
<ul>
  <li>Communicate with your&nbsp; tutor or with the instructor. They may be able 
    to help with advice.</li>
  <li>Try a few short question phone&nbsp; calls with your contact person(s). 
  </li>
  <li>Drop off a short questionnaire for pick up later in the week. <br>
    &nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<p><b><font color="#270FFF">IV.&nbsp; Marking Scheme</font></b>
<p>Marks for this assignment will depend on the following factors:
<p><b><font color="#FF0F33">Problem identification (30%):</font></b> How well 
  have you researched the problem, and the organization you are dealing with by 
  talking to people, reading documents etc. How hard is your problem? (e.g., studying 
  an existing system for a large organization is harder than studying the possibility 
  of a new system for a small store). 
<p><b><font color="#FF0714">Alternatives and criteria (30%):</font></b>
Have you considered obvious alternatives? ...interesting ones? How well
defined are your criteria and how thorough is your evaluation? Are your
recommendations backed by appropriate evidence? Are they reasonable?
<p><b><font color="#FF0F2F">Supporting evidence (20%):</font></b> The supporting 
  evidence you include in terms of figures, tables, cost/benefit analysis etc. 
  Also, organization of appendices; usefulness of supporting information; how 
  well does the evidence support the recommendations? 
<p><b><font color="#FF0C21">Presentation (20%)</font></b>: The style of
your presentation, including language, grammar, clarity of the presentation
etc.
<br>&nbsp;10% - Language
<br>&nbsp;10% - Style and clarity
<p>Note: The top three assignments will be posted on the course website,
and will get for this a 5% bonus on this assignment.
