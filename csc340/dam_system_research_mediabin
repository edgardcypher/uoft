Core Capabilities:

	Catalog All Files. Ingests and manages any file (images, documents, layouts, video, audio, etc.) and all asset metadata--with high quality previews of images and documents--including Adobe PDFs, Microsoft Office 
	and QuarkXPress documents.

	Web Interface. Provides secure, intuitive, Web-based access to all files.

	View All Pages. You can view individual pages of PDF files, PowerPoint presentations, and other multi-page documents and multi-layer files (i.e., Adobe Photoshop) before downloading them, saving both time and 
	bandwidth.

	Stream Video. Creates streaming video previews of rich media formats so that you don't need to download the entire asset just to preview it.

	Repurpose Images. Translates images to various formats, including Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop PSD and EPS, vector EPS, TGA, TIFF, JPEG, GIF, PNG, BMP, Photo CD and STiNG. Users can download images in any 
	format, size, resolution, and/or color space. Run-time parameters enable users to specify output options in real time.

	Easy Import/Ingest. You can drag and drop assets into MediaBin, which automatically generates asset previews, stores metadata, and preserves folder hierarchies.

	Efficient Storage. Stores one "core image asset" and creates all renditions from the source.

	Email Assets. You can email shortcuts to assets that link directly to MediaBin or email attachments.

	Flexible Metadata Handling. Stores and edits asset metadata with the ability to add unlimited metadata fields. Bulk metadata editing enables quick updates to multiple files.

	Multiple Search Methods. You can search for assets based on metadata, image content/visual similarity, or a combination of both.

	Security. Controls access to assets and predefined image formats through remote, Web-based security administration.

	Version Control. Manages asset updates through comprehensive version control - "check in/check out." Also provides version control for metadata.

	Detailed Activity Logging. Administrators can see who downloads what and when. Tags assets derived from MediaBin so that they can be traced back to the core asset.

	XML Support. You can share data with other applications and systems using XML export and import routines.

	High-volume Processing. Accommodates high-volume, complex imaging tasks from many distributed clients.

	Shopping Cart Folder. You can gather specific files you need in a temporary holding folder and download them together.

	LDAP Support. Administrators can control system access using existing corporate directories, including Windows Domains, Active Directory, or LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol).

	Back-up Wizard. You can control backup, security, and other system administration functions through the MediaBin Enterprise Management Console.

	Full Set of APIs. Using well-documented and robust APIs, companies can customize MediaBin's "out-of-the-box" functionality. We can fully integrate MediaBin Asset Manager into other corporate systems such as 
	commerce platforms, Web Content Management systems, ERP, CRM, etc., and create custom Web interfaces and applications. Programming interfaces supported include: Microsoft COM automation scripts (Visual Basic or 
	Active Server Pages), C++, and the native Java interface.

	Quick Installation.
