<p><b>Assignment 2: Preparing a Requirements Specification</b> <br>
  &nbsp;
<p><b><font color="#FF0C1D">Due Date: 12 midday, Friday, November 8</font></b> 
  (to BA5234)<br>
  <b><font color="#FF0C1D">This assignment counts&nbsp; for 15% of the final grade</font></b> 
  <br>
  &nbsp;
<br>
  Prepare a requirements specification for an information system project of your 
  own choice, which relates to an existing organization. This project is meant 
  to give you exposure to basic concepts discussed in the course, and also to 
  encourage you to "look around" for the type of work you may be doing in a few 
  years as computer science professional. 
<p> The project is to be carried out by teams of three. Each team will submit 
  one report.<br>

<p><b><font color="#130FFF">I.&nbsp;&nbsp; Doing the Assignment</font></b>
<p>This assignment has seven steps.&nbsp; They are: 
<p> 1. <em>Choose a problem</em> for which the development of a new (or replacement) 
  information system is a suitable solution. You can use the problem and proposed 
  solution that you identified in your feasibility report. Alternatively, you 
  can use a problem identified by another team in their feasibility report (in 
  which case that team gets a 2% bonus on assignment 1); <br>
  2. <em>Describe the problem and the alternative</em> you have selected in detail 
  (you may want to go beyond what was done in the feasibility study, or correct 
  flaws the marker pointed out); <br>
  3. <em>Identify the requirements,</em> including all functional and non-functional 
  requirements for the new system, the data that the system will need to manage, 
  interfaces to other systems, and interfaces for different classes of users; 
  <br>
  4. <em>Prepare use case, class, sequence, and state diagrams, and a glossary</em> 
  to describe in more detail the functional and data requirements for the new 
  system; <br>
  5. <em>Discuss the requirements</em> you have generated with the contact person(s) 
  in the customer organization, and get feedback. Don't forget to describe any 
  meetings, discussions and feedback in an appendix of your report. <br>
  6. <em>Write a report</em> that describes the problem you chose, the requirements 
  you identified, the models you generated, and the discussions you had with the 
  client.<br>
  <em>7. Document your teamwork</em> and complete a team report (see attached 
  form). <br>

<p><b><font color="#120AFF">II.&nbsp;&nbsp; What to Hand In</font></b>
<p>Hand in your report to the professor by midday on the due date. <em>Reports 
  not handed in by 12:01pm will be treated as late.</em> 
<p>You should hand in a report of requirements analysis, not exceeding twenty-five 
  (25) pages (not counting references, appendices, figures or tables). Assume 
  that the assignment you hand in will be read by managers <em>and</em> software 
  designers. This means that the document part of the assignment should be readable 
  by non-technical readers, while the UML diagrams and more technical details 
  should be presented in appendices. As with the feasibility study, make every 
  effort to be clear and concise about your recommendations in your presentation.
<p><b><font color="#12A61E">Written Presentation Requirements</font></b>
<p>Drawings must be clear and legible. Be sure to put on a cover page indicating 
  the names of all team members, title of work, course, date and tutor's name. 
  Assignments will be judged on the basis of visual appearance, grammatical correctness 
  and quality of writing, as well as their contents. 
<p>Please make sure that the text of your assignment is well-structured, using 
  paragraphs, full sentences, and other features of a well-written presentation. 
  The report must not consist of itemized lists of points. Text font size should 
  be either 10 or 12 points.<br>

<p><b><font color="#270FFF">III.&nbsp; Marking Scheme</font></b> 
<p>Marks for this assignment will depend on the following factors:
<p><b><font color="#FF0F33">Requirements specification (30%):</font></b> Completeness, consistency and clarity;
<p><b><font color="#FF0714">UML diagrams (40%):</font></b>
Completeness and correctness of your diagrams;
<p><b><font color="#FF0F2F">Supporting evidence (10%):</font></b> Appendices which describe meetings and other information on the preparation of the assignment; supporting documentation for your UML diagrams;
<p><b><font color="#FF0C21">Presentation (20%)</font></b>: The style of
your presentation, including language, grammar, clarity of the presentation
etc.
<br>&nbsp;10% - Language
<br>&nbsp;10% - Style and clarity
<p>Note: The top three assignments will be posted on the course website,
and will get for this a 5% bonus on this assignment.
