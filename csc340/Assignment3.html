<p align="left"><strong>Assignment 3: Detailed Design for an Information System 
  </strong>
<p align="left"><font color="#FF1119"><strong>Due Date: 12:00 midday Friday December 
  6, 2002<font color="#000000"> </font></strong><font color="#000000">(to BA 5234)</font><strong><br>
  This assignment counts for 20% of the final grade</strong></font> 
<p>Prepare a detailed design for the information system you have been working 
  on for assignments 1 and 2. The detailed design should include selection of 
  hardware, networking and software for the new system, design of a global architecture, 
  a detailed design for the classes that are part of the system, a relational 
  database schema and suitable I/O procedures and interfaces. 
<p>This assignment is to be carried out by teams of three. Teams of two will be 
  allowed when no third member is available. Each team will submit one report.
<p><b><font color="#230FFF">I. Doing the Assignment</font></b> 
<p><b><font color="#000000">This assignment has eight steps. They are:</font></b> 
<p>1. <em>Review your requirements specification</em> from assignment 2, and revise 
  it on the basis of the comments you received from the marker. 
<p>2. <em>Define a global architectural design </em>for the system, consisting 
  of computer networks (existing or new), hardware (existing or new) and software 
  platform (operating system and any other commercial software you will be using 
  for your system). 
<p>3. <em>Select hardware, software and networking </em>to be purchased for the 
  new system. Specify clearly the criteria and alternatives you are using for 
  your decision. 
<p>4. <em>Propose a software architecture</em> for the new system and justify 
  your choice. 
<p>5. <em>Prepare a detailed design of the classes</em> that are part of your 
  system, using detailed class diagrams. Define signatures for all attributes 
  and operations. Include interaction and state diagrams to show detailed object 
  interactions.
<p>6. <em>Design the database schema</em> for the database component of your system. 
  Take into account workloads in proposing a relational database schema. Use both 
  class diagrams and ER diagrams to describe the contents of your database before 
  you generate a relational schema. 
<p>7. <em>Design prototype user interfaces</em> for the use cases identified in 
  your analysis model. Also, define any other external interfaces (e.g. with other 
  software systems, specialized devices, etc)
<p>8. <em>Write a report </em>describing&nbsp; the complete system design. The 
  report should include as an appendix the requirements specification on which 
  your design was based and a careful account of how all requirements (functional 
  and non-functional) were addressed in the design.
<p><b><font color="#0A0EFF">II. What to Hand In</font></b>
<p>Hand in your report to the professor by midday on the due date. <em>Reports 
  not handed in by 12.01pm will be treated as late.</em>
<p>Your report should not exceeding twenty-five (25) pages (not counting references, 
  appendices, figures or tables). Assume that the assignment you hand in will 
  be read by the programmers responsible for implementing the system. This means 
  that the technical details need to be presented clearly, and your report should 
  provide enough rationale to enable the programmers to understand the design 
  decisions you have made.&nbsp;<b><font
color="#140CFF"></font></b> 
<p><b><font color="#12A61E">Written Presentation Requirements</font></b> 
<p>Drawings must be clear and legible. Be sure to put on a cover page indicating 
  the names of all team members, title of work, course, date and tutor's name. 
  Assignments will be judged on the basis of visual appearance, grammatical correctness 
  and quality of writing, as well as their contents. 
<p>Please make sure that the text of your assignment is well-structured, using 
  paragraphs, full sentences, and other features of a well-written presentation. 
  The report must not consist of itemized lists of points. Text font size should 
  be either 10 or 12 points.
<p><b><font color="#140CFF">III. The Marking Scheme</font></b> 
<p>The marking scheme for this assignment will include the following factors: 
<p><b><font color="#FF0C21">Global Architecture (20%):</font></b><font
color="#FF0C21"> <font color="#000000">Includes a description of the global architecture 
  of your system, as well as the hardware, networking and software platform on 
  which it will run; also includes the global software architecture of your system;</font></font> 
<p><b><font color="#FF0C21">Detailed Program Design (20%):</font></b><font

  </font></b><font color="#000000">Includes the relational schema of your system's 
  database and the process by which it was derived from class diagrams;</font></font><font color="#000000"> 
  </font>
<p><font color="#FF0C21"><b>Detailed Interface Design (20%):</b> <font color="#000000">Covers 
  the design of interaction classes and user interfaces;</font></font><font color="#000000">
