The ability of the network to distinguish between the two classes can be
assessed by looking at the means of the scores assigned to the two data sets.
For a particular number of hidden units and training epochs we calculate the
means for both data sets and investigate the squared distance between them.
Maximizing this distance corresponds to maximizing the the networks ability to
separate between the two classes. 

To achieve this we varied the number of hidden units between 1 and 201 in steps
of 10 and varied the number of training epochs between 10 and 410 in steps of
50. For each combination of these we record the squared distance between the
means of the scores for two data sets. We pick the model that maximizes this
distance as the best model for solving this task.
