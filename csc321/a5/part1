The ability of the network to recognize the two classes can be
assessed by looking at the means of the scores assigned to the two data sets.
For a particular number of hidden units and training epochs we calculate the
means for both data sets and investigate the squared distance between them.
Maximizing this distance corresponds to maximizing the networks' ability to
recognize the two classes. 

To achieve this we varied the number of hidden units between 1 and 201 in steps
of 10 and varied the number of training epochs between 10 and 410 in steps of
50. For each combination of these we record the squared distance between the
means of the scores for two data sets. We pick the model that maximizes this
distance as the best model for solving this task.

N.B. The script ran for over 3 hours and when it terminated it turned out that
some variable namings in the script replicated those defined in the main body of
the program. For that reason we were unable to present the definitive number of
hidden units and epochs that best suit this task. We present here a graph for
110 hidden units and 400 training epochs. This model is adequate at solving the
given task as can be seen from the graph. The code for the script is included
with the assignment.
