a) Since for any disk that is out of place the neighouring state either puts the
disk in place, leaves the disk where it is, or puts it in another spot where it
is out of place for any configuration N there exists a neighbouring 
configuration N' such that h1(N,D) >= h1(N',D). Thus h1 satisfies the monotone
restriction.

b),c) Admissibility does in fact hold for h2 and h3 since the minimal number of
moves it takes to move 4 disks stacked on top of each other which are misplaced 
into 4 disks stacked on top of each other which are in place is in fact 2^4 - 1
= 15  >= the estimates of 10 and 15 given by h2 and h3. Since this configuration
corresponds to the longest distance between a state and any goal the two
heuristics are in fact admissible.
