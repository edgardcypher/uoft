Here are the test cases for Assignment 4, Q1.

====================================================================

-> note: there may be a lot of actions depending on how you encode
your domain. If there are too many, idrplan may have memory difficulties
on CDF. So in the "actlist" in your Prolog spec. of each problem, you
should feel free to only mention the "sensible" actions (e.g., if
you have an action that moves the robot from Location1 to Location2,
you only need to list ground instances of that action where Location1
and Location2 are different).

====================================================================

Parcel delivery domain:

Test Case 1:
------------

startstate:
* the robot is in Sandford Fleming
* parcel1 is in Sandford Fleming
* parcel2 is in Bahen
* it's raining
* robot is not wet
* umbrella is in Sandford Fleming
* robot is not carrying any parcel nor the umbrella

goallist:
* parcel1 is in Pratt
* parcel2 is in Bahen
* Robot is not wet

Test Case 2:
------------

startstate:
* the robot is in Pratt
* parcel1 is in Sandford Fleming
* it's raining
* robot is not wet
* umbrella is in Sandford Fleming
* robot is not carrying any parcel nor the umbrella

goallist:
* parcel1 is in Pratt
* Robot is wet
* Robot is holding the umbrella

================================================================

Rover Domain:


Test Case 1:
------------

objects: 

* rovers: rov1
* instruments: instr1
* operations: therm, spectr
* orientations: face, back

startstate:
* rov1 is back to the sun
* instr1 is on rov1 and is not turned on
* instr1 supports both spectr and therm

goallist:
* you want both thermographic and spectrographic images of the soil,
back to the sun


Test Case 2:
------------

objects:

* rovers: rov1
* instruments: instr1, instr2
* operations: therm, spectr
* orientations: face, back

startstate:
* rov1 is facing the sun 
* instr1, instr2 are on rov1 
* instr1 is turned on and warmed up
* instr1 supports therm
* instr2 supports spectr
* you already have a thermographic image of the soil facing the sun

goallist:
* you want both thermographic and spectrographic images of the soil,
facing the sun
* you want a thermographic image of the soil, back to the sun
